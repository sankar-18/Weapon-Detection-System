This project involves developing a real-time weapon detection application using the Yolov7 object detection model. The application is designed to detect and identify weapons in real-time video feeds, providing immediate alerts to enhance security and response times.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Utilizes the Yolov7 model to detect weapons in live video streams with high accuracy.
Image Annotation: Over 10,000 images annotated using Roboflow to train and validate the model.
Optimized Performance: Hyperparameter tuning to achieve a 15% improvement in detection accuracy and a 20% reduction in false positives.
Alert System: Integrated real-time alert system that provides immediate notifications, improving response times by 30%.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing consists of 10,000+ annotated images, which can be accessed and managed through Roboflow. Ensure you have the necessary access and API keys configured.

Results
Detection Accuracy: Improved by 15% through extensive hyperparameter tuning.
False Positives: Reduced by 20% to ensure reliable detection.
Response Time: Enhanced by 30% with the integrated real-time alert system.
